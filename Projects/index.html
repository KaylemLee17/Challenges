    I only had <strong>coffee</strong> for breakfast this morning.
    <p>This morning I got up at <strong>6:40am</strong>. I thought I was gonna be late to catch my <strong>bus</strong>. I had to rush to get done. <em>Luckily</em>, I made my bus just <strong>on time.</strong> When I got out of the bus this morning the rain got me while I was walking to campus.</p>
